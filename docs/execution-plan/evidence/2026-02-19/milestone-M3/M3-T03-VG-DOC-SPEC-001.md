# M3-T03 VG-DOC-SPEC-001
Date: 2026-02-19
Task: M3-T03 Reconcile SPEC-26 and SPEC-27 with runtime architecture
Gate: VG-DOC-SPEC-001
Result: pass

## Checklist

- [x] SPEC-26 includes explicit implemented vs planned status snapshot.
- [x] SPEC-26 acceptance criteria reflect current runtime behavior (implemented/partial/planned).
- [x] SPEC-26 test plan now references real tests and explicitly marks integration gaps.
- [x] SPEC-27 includes explicit implemented vs planned status snapshot.
- [x] SPEC-27 acceptance criteria reflect current runtime behavior.
- [x] SPEC-27 integration section clearly marked as planned architecture.
- [x] SPEC-27 test plan now references real fallback tests and integration gap.
- [x] Test-reference existence check captured (`M3-T03-test-reference-check.txt`).

## Conclusion

SPEC-26 and SPEC-27 now separate implemented behavior from planned architecture, reducing ambiguity for execution and review.
