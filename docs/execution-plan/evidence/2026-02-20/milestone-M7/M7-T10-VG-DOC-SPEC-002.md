# M7-T10 VG-DOC-SPEC-002
Date: 2026-02-20
Task: M7-T10 spec/governance reconciliation and promotion

## Scope
Reconcile SPEC-20 through SPEC-27 status metadata, implementation snapshots, and up-next critical gap traceability after M7 runtime closure.

## Checklist
- [x] SPEC-20..SPEC-27 status headers reviewed and aligned with current runtime truth.
- [x] Implementation snapshot timestamps reconciled to current review date where needed.
- [x] Remaining critical items are explicitly tied to a tracked up-next backlog issue (`loop-azq`).
- [x] M7 closure sequence in execution-plan trackers reflects `M7-T01`..`M7-T10` ordering and completion state.
- [x] No remaining spec/runtime drift items are left untracked.

## Up-Next Gap Tracking
Residual critical items from partially implemented specs are explicitly tracked in:
- `loop-azq` - Up-next critical SPEC refinements backlog

## Result
- Pass
- SPEC status/governance docs now reflect post-M7 runtime state with explicit up-next critical gap ownership.
