# M7-T10 VG-CONTRACT-001
Date: 2026-02-20
Task: M7-T10 spec/governance reconciliation and promotion

## Scope
Reconcile support-policy and consumer-contract claims against latest M7 evidence.

## Checklist
- [x] Compatibility matrix updated to current review date and evidence pointers.
- [x] Consumer contract requirements include active io-rflx fixture/calibration gate (`VG-RFLX-002`).
- [x] Validation matrix gate commands are executable under current sandbox/safe-run policy.
- [x] Latest consumer gate evidence captured for RCC, loop-agent seam, and io-rflx compile baseline.
- [x] io-rflx schema-first contract explicitly references active fixture corpus and calibration policy.

## Consumer Gate Inputs
- `M7-T10-VG-RCC-001.txt`
- `M7-T10-VG-LA-001.txt`
- `M7-T10-VG-RFLX-001.txt`
- `M7-T09-VG-RFLX-002.txt`

## Result
- Pass
- Support claims are now backed by current M7 consumer evidence and explicit fixture/calibration contract language.
