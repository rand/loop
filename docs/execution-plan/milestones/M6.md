# M6 - Rollout and Steady-State Governance

## Objective

Operationalize the stabilized implementation: release management, rollback safety, compatibility governance, and ongoing maintenance cadence.

## Entry Criteria

- M5 complete with no unresolved release-blocking regressions.

## Exit Criteria

- Compatibility matrix is published and versioned.
- Rollout and rollback playbook is documented.
- Ongoing maintenance process is defined.

## Task Cards

### M6-T01 Publish Compatibility Matrix

- Goal: define which loop versions are validated against which consumer versions.
- Status: done (2026-02-19)
- Work items:
- Create version support table for `loop`, `rlm-claude-code`, `loop-agent`, `io-rflx`.
- Define support window and deprecation lead time.
- Publish matrix and policy doc: `docs/execution-plan/COMPATIBILITY-MATRIX.md`.
- Capture contract gate evidence: `docs/execution-plan/evidence/2026-02-19/milestone-M6/M6-T01-VG-CONTRACT-001.md`.
- Acceptance criteria:
- Matrix is published and referenced from main docs.
- Required gates: VG-CONTRACT-001

### M6-T02 Define Rollout and Rollback Playbook

- Goal: make releases predictable and recoverable.
- Status: done (2026-02-19)
- Work items:
- Define pre-release checklist and mandatory gate set.
- Define rollback triggers (functional, compatibility, performance).
- Define rollback procedure and owner responsibilities.
- Publish playbook: `docs/execution-plan/RELEASE-ROLLBACK-PLAYBOOK.md`.
- Capture contract gate evidence: `docs/execution-plan/evidence/2026-02-19/milestone-M6/M6-T02-VG-CONTRACT-001.md`.
- Acceptance criteria:
- Playbook can be executed without ad hoc interpretation.
- Required gates: VG-CONTRACT-001

### M6-T03 Establish Maintenance Cadence

- Goal: prevent future drift and regressions.
- Status: done (2026-02-19)
- Work items:
- Set review cadence for specs vs runtime behavior.
- Set cadence for cross-repo compatibility runs.
- Assign ownership for decision log and validation matrix updates.
- Publish cadence runbook: `docs/execution-plan/MAINTENANCE-CADENCE.md`.
- Capture contract gate evidence: `docs/execution-plan/evidence/2026-02-19/milestone-M6/M6-T03-VG-CONTRACT-001.md`.
- Acceptance criteria:
- Cadence and ownership are documented.
- Required gates: VG-CONTRACT-001

## Risks

- Without explicit cadence, spec/runtime drift will recur.
- Without rollback criteria, integration changes can destabilize consumers.

## Completion Note

M6 completion marks transition from remediation program to steady-state development.

M6 completed on 2026-02-19.
