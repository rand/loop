# M0 - Foundation and Contract Freeze

## Objective

Establish unambiguous execution constraints before implementation work: compatibility policy, API naming policy, integration scope, and baseline evidence.

## Entry Criteria

- Baseline findings are documented in `STATUS.md`.

## Exit Criteria

- Decisions D-001 through D-006 are either Accepted or explicitly Rejected/Superseded.
- `TASK-REGISTRY.md` reflects approved sequencing and dependencies.
- Contract file reviewed and aligned with current repo state.

## Task Cards

### M0-T01 Baseline Evidence Snapshot

- Status: done
- Goal: capture known failures and coupling risks as starting state.
- Acceptance criteria:
- Baseline findings table is complete in `STATUS.md`.
- High-priority tasks and blockers are mapped.
- Required gates: VG-CONTRACT-001

### M0-T02 Compatibility and Breaking-Change Policy

- Status: done
- Goal: lock criteria for what counts as a breaking change and when it is allowed.
- Work items:
- Approve D-001 compatibility policy.
- Approve D-002 build baseline definition.
- Define whether any temporary breakage is allowed during milestones.
- Acceptance criteria:
- D-001 and D-002 are Accepted.
- M1 and M4 tasks reference these policies.
- Required gates: VG-CONTRACT-001

### M0-T03 REPL Entrypoint Strategy Approval

- Status: done
- Goal: choose module/script startup policy for Python REPL.
- Work items:
- Approve D-003.
- Confirm support expectations for dev and packaged environments.
- Acceptance criteria:
- D-003 marked Accepted.
- M1-T03 task execution details finalized.
- Required gates: VG-CONTRACT-001

### M0-T04 Batched API Naming Strategy Approval

- Status: done
- Goal: resolve `llm_query_batched` vs `llm_batch` contract.
- Work items:
- Approve D-004 canonical name + alias/deprecation plan.
- Confirm migration messaging expectations for consumers.
- Acceptance criteria:
- D-004 marked Accepted.
- M3-T01 unblocked with explicit behavior target.
- Required gates: VG-CONTRACT-001

### M0-T05 Cross-Repo Integration Scope Approval

- Status: done
- Goal: lock scope for `rlm-claude-code`, `loop-agent`, `io-rflx` integration work.
- Work items:
- Approve D-006.
- Confirm required validation depth per consumer.
- Acceptance criteria:
- D-006 marked Accepted.
- M4 tasks unblocked with agreed scope.
- Required gates: VG-CONTRACT-001

## Risks

- Delay in decision approval blocks all implementation milestones.
- Ambiguous compatibility policy causes rework in M3/M4.

## Handoff Notes

At M0 completion, next start point is `M1-T01`.
