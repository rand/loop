# Concepts

This section explains how to think about Loop before you care about where any specific function lives.

## Conceptual Layers

1. **Intent Layer**: User goals and jobs-to-be-done.
2. **Orchestration Layer**: Complexity classification, decomposition, and execution strategy.
3. **Evidence Layer**: Memory, traces, and verification artifacts.
4. **Assurance Layer**: Tests, policy gates, compatibility checks, and release controls.
5. **Decision Layer**: Principle-driven tradeoffs under real constraints.

## Why This Matters

If you skip conceptual grounding and start from implementation details, everything feels random.

If you start here, the codebase reads like a system instead of a haunted attic.
