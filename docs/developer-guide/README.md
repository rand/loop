# Developer Guide

This guide is for contributors changing code in Loop itself.

## Start Here

1. [Setup](./setup.md)
2. [Workflow Cookbook](./workflow-cookbook.md)
3. [Quality Gates](./quality-gates.md)
4. [Contribution Workflow](./contribution-workflow.md)
5. [API Docs Status](./api-docs-status.md)

## Development Contract

1. Build and tests must pass locally.
2. Governance gates must pass.
3. Behavior changes must be documented.
4. Evidence must exist for critical claims.
5. Push-ready means actually pushed, not emotionally prepared.

## Scope Notes

- Runtime planning and multi-session execution rules: `docs/execution-plan/`
- Feature contracts: `docs/spec/`
- Architecture rationale: `docs/adr/`
- Fast command lookup: `docs/reference/command-reference.md`
