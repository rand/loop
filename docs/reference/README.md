# Reference

Reference docs are for fast lookup. Minimal narrative, maximum utility.

## Contents

- `command-reference.md`: canonical command map by workflow.

## When to Use This Section

Use reference docs when you already know what you are doing and just need exact commands or paths.

Use guide docs when you need reasoning, sequencing, or troubleshooting.
